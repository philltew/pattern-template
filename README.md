# freesewing pattern template

This repository contains all the boilerplate to jump-start your freesewing pattern.

It contains:

 - A config file with some options and measurements as example
 - Code structure with two example pattern parts
 - An index HTML file that you can open in your browser to see your progress
 - A package.json file with all the scripts to build/lint/publish your work
 - A rollup configuration that will transpile your code for Node.js, the browser, and as an ES6 module
 - Comes preloaded with the freesewing plugin bundle
 - Your HTML preview also loads the theme, designer, validate, and debug plugins
 - Comes with both models and antman to test your patterns with

## Prerquisites

You need [Node](https://nodejs.org/), the JavaScript runtime. 
Depending on your operating system, node may already be installed, 
or you can [download node here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

With node setup, you'll also need [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/), 
and [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/).

Rollup is the bundler that will package your code. Nodemon will help your 
development by rebuilding your code when you make changes.

If you already have these installed, carry on. If not, install them:

```
npm install -g rollup nodemon
```

## Getting started

Simply fork this repository, or download a local copy.
Then, in its root directory run:

```
npm install
```

This will install all dependencies. When you're done, you can run:

```js
npm run build
```

Which will build the code for all targets.

You can open the index.html file in your browser, and it will show your pattern.

## Configuration

To make this pattern your own, all you have to do is pick a name. 
Then, change **template** into your own name in both the config file
and package.json.

## Development

The source code is in the src directory. You can make changes and check your 
progress in your browser. 

Make sure to keep the browser console open, as the debug plugin will provide you
with extra info there. This pattern also comes with the designer plugin that will
log info to the console when you hover over a point.

While developing, you can speed up your build by running:

```js
npm run browserbuild
```

As this will only run the build for the browser.
